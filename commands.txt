To build docker image
docker compose up --build(recommended)

create an account on docker hub

on cmd:
docker login
it will prompt for docker hub username and password

tag your image
docker tag health-app-backend <your docker hub username>/health-app-backend:latest
docker push <your docker hub username>/health-app-backend:latest


create an EC2 instance(Amazon Linux)
in the security group, add inbound rule for port 3000(Custom TCP)

for mongodb we are using mongodb atlas.
in atlas go to network access and add the public ip of your EC2 instance as allowed ip

connect to your EC2 instance
install docker on that instance
sudo su -
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install docker -y
sudo systemctl start docker


now pull the image from docker hub
docker pull sudhaagarwal/health-app-backend:latest

docker run --name health-app -p 3000:3000 sudhaagarwal/health-app-backend:latest

you will public ip for EC2 instance
your application would be accessible at
<your-ec2-public-ip>:3000
